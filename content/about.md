Lets pretend you are a real person, and I'll pretend to introduce myself and impress you (in third person). For your information, I am very much a real person, to prove it, there is a picture of me (seeeee, i am in the left, computer is in the right).

The name is Trim, Trim BRESILLA (pun intended), and currently he's working as a PostDoc at University of Bologna. He's got some degrees and cerificates, but that doesn't matter much, cause that just represents the past. He's a robotics engineer and plant physiologist by trade, however he try to do more than that and more than and he pretends to even do more. <i> Kids nowadays ... remind me, how does the saying go ... em ... ah, found it... "Jack of all trades, master of none"</i>.
<p align="justify">
He is focused on research for the moment. Trying to utilize/develop tools to understand the plants growth behavior. He plays around with a lot of electronics and uses neural-networks to achieve this. Develops sensors and algorithms to predict plant stress and status, to estimate cropload, detect deseases, utiize irrigation, fertigation and spraying. For a more serious resume of his career, check his not so overboard, <a href="https://bresilla.com/resume/resume" style="color: #04f977;">'wanna be proffesional' resume</a>.

In real life, he's a huge "space and time" nerd, "why do we exist" kind of guy, or better one: "do we actually exist, and if we do, can we prove it". He reads tons of physiosophy books. Basically, when in party, he's a buzz kiler, but in the bright side, he's very self-aware, and usually dosn't speak unless asked.

If you wanna know him better, so if in case you meet in physical world(s) sometime (again, he's am a real person), you can check his lists below. Cos, he's wierd and likes to top list everything. And like his grandfather used to say: "Tell me what you do, and i tell you if you're my friend"
