Cliché riiight?? Noone will ever bother to check my website, let alone browse through it, but anyways, lets pretend you are a real person, and I'll pretend to introduce myself and try to impress you. BTHW, I am a real person, to prove I put a picture (see picture, i am in the left, computer is in the right).

Hi there, my name is Trim, welcome to my website. Soooo, about me, well, currently I’m working as a PostDoc at University of Bologna. I have some degrees and cerificates, but that doesn't matter much, cause that just represents the past. I think in this day and age, anyone could reach any knowledge level, just needs persistence and will. I'm a robotics engineer and plant physiologist by trade, however i try to do whole more than that. I am just like the saying "Jack of all trades, master of none".
<p align="justify">
My main focus is on research for the moment. I am trying to utilize/develop tools to understand the plants growth behavior. I play a lot with electronics to achieve this. Developing sensors and algorithms to predict plant stress and status, to estimate cropload, detect deseases, utiize irrigation, fertigation and spraying. For a more serious resume of my career, check my standard, not overboard, <a href="https://bresilla.com/resume/resume" style="color: #04f977;">'i wanna be proffesional' curriculum vitae</a>. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
I’m interested in software engineering and hardawre development in general: data structures, algorithms, protocols, architecture, microcontroller programming, design patterns and much more. I am trying to develop my own <a href="https://follang.org">programming language</a>. I like reverse engineering everything, i really enjoy taking things apart and see how they work. I like making little robots and autonomus tools to halp farmers (my uncle, one of them) make more food. To friends and family i am the guy that computers like, and their free- "i have a small computer problem" guy. Toghether with my father, we have a little comapny, that makes smart house designs ("i want to trun on my house heating when i am 2km near the house" kind of thing).
</p>

<p align="justify">
In real life, i am a huge "space and time" nerd, "why do we exist" kind of guy, or better one: "do we actually exist, and if you think we do, can you prove it". I read ton of physiosophy books. I am amazed by the fact of 'one's self' and how just some animals can recognise temselves in the mirror and so on. Basically, when in party, i try not to speak, othervise i am a buzz kiler, but *important to note here* I am self-aware.

Anywayssss (to be self-aware that this is already too long), this is my blog, one of my many procrastinated projects. I wish you can learn something from here. I wish to post regularly, but in reality I usually do that, when i get pumped reeading someone's else awsome protfolio and think i can do the same. If you want to stay in touch, reach me at Twitter or check my Github account for projects and other things as i spent mose of my productive time there.

If you wanna know me better, so if in case we meet in physical world(s) sometime (cos i am a real person), you can check my lists below, which ranks my top everything. Cos, I'm wierd like that and like to top list everything.
