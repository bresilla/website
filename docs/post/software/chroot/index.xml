      <description>The why? So, lately i&amp;rsquo;ve been deeply involved with *nix&amp;rsquo;s namespaces and cgrpups. I am trying to build ths tool called: tent, which basically at high level is a chroot clone but with modern flare. So it has some automatic mounting points, user directora manupilations etc&amp;hellip;
Along the way, i got to learn quite a lot how linux handles containers, especially with liblxc. The way i was going with it was by trying to understand how Canonical&amp;rsquo;s lxd (lxc) works.</description>
