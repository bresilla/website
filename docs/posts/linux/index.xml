      <description>The why? So, lately i&amp;rsquo;ve been deeply involved with *nix&amp;rsquo;s namespaces and cgrpups. I am trying to build ths tool called: tent, which basically at high level is a chroot clone but with modern flare. So it has some automatic mounting points, user directora manupilations etc&amp;hellip;
Along the way, i got to learn quite a lot how linux handles containers, especially with liblxc. The way i was going with it was by trying to understand how Canonical&amp;rsquo;s lxd (lxc) works.</description>

      <description>THE WHY Here is the thing, I have no secrets of my own! Zero, zilch, zip, nada, nothing. However, this does not mean I am open to anyone to browse what I do and how I do. I like my life to be private. If somebody asks me anything (even a personal query), and if I find it reasonable (which most of the cases I do), I give the answer. I am very careful about what share and how I share.</description>
