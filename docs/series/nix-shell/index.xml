      <description>Enter NIX It’s difficult to categorize Nix. On the website, it is presented as a “purely functional package manager”. However, it could also be thought of as a programming language, a configuration tool, and a build tool. In a nutshell, Nix expressions are programs written in a purely functional programming language and can return a single derivation or a set of derivations.
This difficulty to categorize comes due to a few different projects sharing similar names.</description>
