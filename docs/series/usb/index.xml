      <description>Creators The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a specification developed by Compaq, Intel, Microsoft and NEC, joined later by Hewlett-Packard, Lucent and Philips. These companies formed the USB Implementers Forum, Inc as a non-profit corporation to publish the specifications and organise further development in USB.
Versioning Despite how long the USB standard has been around, the USB standard hasnâ€™t really gone through a whole lot of major versions although there have been quite a few smaller revisions within each version.</description>
