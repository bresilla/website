      <description>THE WHY Here is the thing, I have no secrets of my own! Zero, zilch, zip, nada, nothing. However, this does not mean I am open to anyone to browse what I do and how I do. I like my life to be private. If somebody asks me anything (even a personal query), and if I find it reasonable (which most of the cases I do), I give the answer. I am very careful about what share and how I share.</description>

      <title>Guide to using YubiKey for GPG and SSH</title>

      <description>This is a guide to using YubiKey as a SmartCard for storing GPG encryption, signing and authentication keys, which can also be used for SSH. Many of the principles in this document are applicable to other smart card devices.
Keys stored on YubiKey are non-exportable (as opposed to file-based keys that are stored on disk) and are convenient for everyday use. Instead of having to remember and enter passphrases to unlock SSH/GPG keys, YubiKey needs only a physical touch after being unlocked with a PIN.</description>
