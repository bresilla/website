      <description>The why Here is the thing, I have no secrets of my own! Zero, zilch, zip, nada, nothing. However, this does not mean I am open to anyone to browse what I do and how I do. I like my life to be private. If somebody asks me anything (even a personal query), and if I find it reasonable (which most of the cases I do), I give the answer. I am very careful about what share and how I share.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer !! This is not a post of mine. Its completely A to Z copy and paste from the amazing drduh (https://github.com/drduh) post (link in the title). This is too amazing to be left just in one place, the interent is very fragile place, it might get broken anytime, so haveing in two places is better, ironic right?? This is internet too, but whatever fude. And is faster for me to find it.</description>
